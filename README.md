# Attuor

This is Attuor. Attuor is latin for 'observe', it will be a free and open source monitoring solution, based on Python and pretty default stuff. The goal is to keep it as simple and pluggable as possible so people can build their own modules for authentication and notification.

The client needs to be lean and mean to make it portable enough to run on almost any platform. Currently, we tested the client on the following OS'es:

 * Debian Buster
 * FreeBSD 12
 * Windows Server 2016 (It started, prolly works as well) 

The server has been tested on:

 * Debian Buster
 * FreeBSD 12

# Current status
This is extreme alpha, more a proof of concept. My coding-skillz aren't brilliant but I wanted to show what the idea of Attuor is. I welcome you all to improve this software, send Merge Requests, create issues. Let's try and create a monitoring solution that is both elegant and simple, and runs just about anywhere.
